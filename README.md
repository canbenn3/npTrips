To test, you will need to have your own Google Api key. run the following in your terminal:

`cp .env.example .ev`

Then replace `VITE_API_KEY` with your own personal google api key (visit https://developers.google.com/maps to create one if you don't already have one). Note that if you exceed a certain number of api calls you will be charged.
